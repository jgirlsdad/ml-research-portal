These changes are natural and have been occurring for at least the last 1,000 years.Since the mid-1990s we have been in a warm phase."

   "desc":"The East Pacific - North Pacific (EP- NP) pattern is a Spring-Summer-Fall pattern with three main anomaly centers. The positive phase of this pattern features positive height anomalies located over Alaska/ Western Canada, and negative anomalies over the central North Pacific and eastern North America. Strong positive phases of the EP-NP pattern are associated with a southward shift and intensification of the Pacific jet stream from eastern Asia to the eastern North Pacific, followed downstream by an enhanced anticyclonic circulation over western North America, and by an enhanced cyclonic circulation over the eastern United States. Strong negative phases of the pattern are associated with circulation anomalies of opposite sign in these regions."
